# four-in-a-row

#####A Connect4 clone created to show the what can be done with [ProcessingJS](http://processingjs.org/), a port of the [Processing Visualization Language](https://processing.org/).

### [Try it here!](http://studio.sketchpad.cc/sp/pad/view/JPHA42Cimt/latest)

Feel free to fork and edit the code to make to your liking.

This version specifically works in the [sketchpad.cc](http://sketchpad.cc) environment and has not been tested outside of this editor.
It uses small bits of JavaScript (mainly the  alert() function) which may cause issue with other versions of Processing.
